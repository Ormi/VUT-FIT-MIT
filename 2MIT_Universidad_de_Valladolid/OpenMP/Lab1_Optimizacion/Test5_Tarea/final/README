==========================

Same for old gaussSeidel and new version of GaussSeidel from Monday.

I was trying caching, tiling, reverse cycles (from SIZE to 0), rebuilding algorithms but my time was still the same, worse or computing failed because I get wrong check-sum.

gaussSeidel3.c
	trying tiling as seen on laboratories, with triangulation method and SIZE exact to 2879 (prime number) it was imposible. Trying to optimize 2D arrays to 1D arrays, without success

gaussSeidel4.c
	basic loop gathering, optimizing with temp variables to save array memory readings, dividiving the whole equation to get multiplication separately. No significant speed-up

gaussSeidel5.c
	using basic loop nest optimatization to gaussSeidel4.c, worst.

gaussSeidel6.c
	rebuilding the whole algorithm, not succesfull check sum.
